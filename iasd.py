            After retrieving all patients that are waiting for the current state, it's necessary to check
            first if the number of those patients is equal or lower than the number of medics. If so, 
            then it's just necessary to return only and only one action for those patients, since the order
            does not matter (no one will be harmed in waiting time) and, if needed, with some 'empty's to
            fill the possible gap. Otherwise, it's needed to divide the list of all patients that are 
            waiting in urgent and not urgent ones. There are four possibilities for the urgent list:  
            or the length of the list is higher, equal or lower than the than the number of medics. 
            If its empty, we just use all the patients to compute the permutations. For the second one, we 
            just return an empty list since there is no more possible ways to proceed in search. For the third 
            one, we compute all permutations between the patients for the medic assignment and return them.

            the urgent patients. And for the last one we just return all possible permutations regarding the 
            number of patients related to the number of medics, i.e., some 'empty's must be added to keep
